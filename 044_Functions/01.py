Student Registration System – Longest Name

A school is organizing an inter-school cultural event. During the registration process, the coordinator notices that some students have very long names, which may not fit properly on the printed ID cards.

As a software developer, your task is to write a Python program that identifies the student with the longest name from the list of registered students using the reduce() function along with a lambda expression.

Input
students = ["Riya", "Christopher", "Aman", "Neha", "Siddharth"]
Expected Output
Student with the longest name: Christopher

from functools import reduce
print("Enter students: ")
students=list(input().split())
res=reduce(lambda x,y: x if x>y else y, students )
print("Student with the longest name: ",res)
