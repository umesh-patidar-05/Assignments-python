CASE STUDY: Hospital Management & Appointment System


============================================================
1. BUSINESS SCENARIO
============================================================

A private hospital wants to develop a MySQL database to manage its daily operations.

The hospital has departments, doctors, patients, appointments, prescriptions and
medicines.

A patient can visit the hospital multiple times. Every visit is recorded as an
appointment between a patient and a doctor.

Each doctor belongs to a department.

After an appointment, the doctor may create a prescription. A prescription can
contain multiple medicines.

The hospital also wants the database to maintain historical records wherever
required.

Your task is to analyze the business requirements and design the database.


============================================================

============================================================
6. APPOINTMENT
============================================================

The hospital wants to maintain appointment information.

Each appointment belongs to:
- One patient
- One doctor
- One department

Therefore, the APPOINTMENT table will contain MULTIPLE FOREIGN KEYS.

Required columns:

appointment_id
appointment_date
appointment_time
patient_id
doctor_id
department_id
status


The following data must be inserted:

appointment_id | date       | time  | patient_id | doctor_id | department_id | status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
501             | 2026-09-01 | 10:00 | 301        | 201       | 101           | Completed
502             | 2026-09-01 | 11:00 | 302        | 202       | 102           | Completed
503             | 2026-09-02 | 09:30 | 303        | 203       | 103           | Completed
504             | 2026-09-02 | 12:00 | 304        | 204       | 104           | Cancelled
505             | 2026-09-03 | 10:30 | 301        | 205       | 101           | Completed
506             | 2026-09-03 | 11:30 | 305        | 203       | 103           | Completed
507             | 2026-09-04 | 09:00 | 306        | 201       | 101           | Scheduled
508             | 2026-09-04 | 14:00 | 302        | 202       | 102           | Scheduled


============================================================
7. PRESCRIPTION
============================================================

After an appointment, a doctor can create a prescription.

Each prescription belongs to:
- One appointment
- One patient
- One doctor

Required columns:

prescription_id
prescription_date
appointment_id
patient_id
doctor_id
remarks


Data:

prescription_id | date       | appointment_id | patient_id | doctor_id | remarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
601             | 2026-09-01 | 501            | 301        | 201       | BP observation
602             | 2026-09-01 | 502            | 302        | 202       | Migraine treatment
603             | 2026-09-02 | 503            | 303        | 203       | Knee pain
604             | 2026-09-03 | 505            | 301        | 205       | Heart checkup
605             | 2026-09-03 | 506            | 305        | 203       | Back pain


============================================================
8. PRESCRIPTION_MEDICINE
============================================================

One prescription can contain multiple medicines.

One medicine can be used in multiple prescriptions.

Therefore, this is a MANY-TO-MANY relationship.

Create a bridge table:

prescription_medicine

Required columns:

prescription_id
medicine_id
dosage
duration_days
quantity

Use a COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY:

PRIMARY KEY (prescription_id, medicine_id)


Data:

prescription_id | medicine_id | dosage | duration_days | quantity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
601             | 401         | 1-0-1  | 5             | 10
601             | 403         | 1-0-0  | 5             | 5
602             | 403         | 1-0-0  | 7             | 7
602             | 406         | 0-0-1  | 5             | 5
603             | 405         | 1-0-1  | 5             | 10
603             | 403         | 1-0-0  | 5             | 5
604             | 401         | 1-0-1  | 3             | 6
604             | 403         | 1-0-0  | 3             | 3
605             | 405         | 1-0-1  | 7             | 14


============================================================
9. RELATIONSHIPS TO IDENTIFY
============================================================

Identify and implement the following relationships:

1. Department -> Doctor

2. Patient -> Appointment

3. Doctor -> Appointment

4. Department -> Appointment

5. Appointment -> Prescription

6. Patient -> Prescription

7. Doctor -> Prescription

8. Prescription -> Prescription_Medicine

9. Medicine -> Prescription_Medicine


IMPORTANT:

Do not simply create the tables randomly.

Analyze which table is the PARENT and which table is the CHILD.


============================================================
10. ON DELETE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

You must choose the correct ON DELETE action based on the following
business scenarios.


SCENARIO A - DEPARTMENT CLOSED
--------------------------------

Department 104 (Dermatology) is closed permanently.

However, doctors who worked in that department should NOT be deleted.

Their department_id should become NULL.

Requirement:

Department -> Doctor

Use an appropriate ON DELETE action so that:

Doctor remains
department_id becomes NULL


SCENARIO B - DOCTOR LEAVES THE HOSPITAL
-----------------------------------------

Doctor 203 leaves the hospital.

The hospital wants to retain historical appointment records.

Therefore, deleting the doctor must NOT delete the appointments.

The doctor reference in existing appointments should become NULL.

Requirement:

Doctor -> Appointment

Use:

ON DELETE SET NULL


SCENARIO C - TEST PATIENT IS DELETED
-------------------------------------

Patient 306 is test/demo data and management wants to permanently
remove this patient.

Appointments belonging to this test patient should also be removed.

Requirement:

Patient -> Appointment

Use:

ON DELETE CASCADE


SCENARIO D - APPOINTMENT IS DELETED
------------------------------------

Appointment 501 is removed from the system.

Any prescription created specifically for that appointment should
also be removed.

Requirement:

Appointment -> Prescription

Use:

ON DELETE CASCADE


SCENARIO E - PRESCRIPTION IS DELETED
-------------------------------------

Prescription 601 is deleted.

Its records from prescription_medicine should automatically be removed.

Requirement:

Prescription -> Prescription_Medicine

Use:

ON DELETE CASCADE


SCENARIO F - MEDICINE IS IN USE
--------------------------------

Medicine 406 is already being used in existing prescriptions.

The hospital wants to protect historical prescription data.

Therefore, a medicine that is referenced by prescription_medicine
should NOT be deleted.

Requirement:

Medicine -> Prescription_Medicine

Use an appropriate action such as:

ON DELETE RESTRICT

Students must explain why ON DELETE CASCADE would be dangerous
in this situation.


============================================================
11. ON UPDATE CASCADE
============================================================

The hospital wants to change some department IDs during a data migration.

For example:

101 -> 1001
102 -> 1002
103 -> 1003
104 -> 1004

When a department ID changes, related foreign key values should
automatically change.

For example:

department.department_id
101 -> 1001

The related values in:

doctor.department_id
appointment.department_id

should automatically change from:

101 -> 1001

Requirement:

Use ON UPDATE CASCADE wherever appropriate.

Students must demonstrate this using an UPDATE statement.


============================================================
12. ON UPDATE SET NULL
============================================================

The hospital also wants to test a different update behavior.

Suppose doctor ID 203 is changed to 250 during an administrative
migration.

For a relationship configured with ON UPDATE SET NULL, the old
doctor reference in child records should become NULL rather than
automatically changing to 250.

Demonstrate:

UPDATE doctor
SET doctor_id = 250
WHERE doctor_id = 203;

Then check the related child records.

Expected behavior for the relationship configured with
ON UPDATE SET NULL:

Old doctor reference -> NULL

Students must explain the difference between:

ON UPDATE CASCADE
and
ON UPDATE SET NULL
