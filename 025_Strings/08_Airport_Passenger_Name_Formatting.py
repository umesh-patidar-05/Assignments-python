Airport Passenger Name Formatting System

An international airport is developing an automated passenger management system. Many passengers enter their details in different formats such as lowercase, uppercase, mixed-case letters, and numbers while booking flight tickets online.

Due to inconsistent formatting, problems occur while generating boarding passes, security verification records, and passenger identity reports.

To solve this issue, the airport authority wants a program that automatically converts only the first character of every word into uppercase while keeping all remaining characters unchanged.

The input may contain:
- Passenger names
- Passport details
- Terminal names
- Seat numbers
- City names
- Mixed uppercase/lowercase letters
- Digits

Task:
Read a complete string from the user and convert the first character of every word into uppercase.

Conditions:
- Words may contain spaces
- Digits should remain unchanged
- Do not use built-in title() function
