Assignment 4:
 Lottery Ticket Verification (Count Occurrences Using Recursion)

A lottery company assigns a unique ticket number to every participant. Before announcing the results, the company wants to determine how many times a lucky digit appears in a ticket number. This helps identify tickets eligible for special bonus rewards.

As a software developer, your task is to write a recursive Python program that counts the number of times a given digit appears in the ticket number.

Digit <Lucky Digit> appears <Count> times.
Sample Input
Enter Ticket Number:
1122334412

Enter Lucky Digit:
2
